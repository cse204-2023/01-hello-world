# Assignment 01-Hello-World

For this assignment, you will be publishing your first webpage! All of the HTML has already been created, all you need to do is replace some text with information about yourself. Once you have followed the instructions below and are looking at the HTML code in your code editor, you will see three areas:

    *** YOUR NAME HERE ***
    *** YOUR EMAIL HERE ***
    *** WHY HERE ***

Simply replace that text with the information it is requesting- your name, your email address, and a few sentences about why you are taking this class.

There are bonus points available for this assignment:

* Change the color of the background and/or the text - 1 bonus point
* Move the text to the center of the page - 1 bonus point
* Add a meaningful photo (of you, your pet, a favorite hobby, your hometown, etc) - 3 bonus points

You will need to follow the "Getting Started" instructions in the class wiki: https://github.com/wustlcse204/class-wiki/wiki/Getting-Started
