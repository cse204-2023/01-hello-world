For this assignment, you will be publishing your first webpage! All of the HTML has already been created, all you need to do is replace some text with information about yourself. Once you have followed the instructions below and are looking at the HTML code in your code editor, you will see three areas:

    *** YOUR NAME HERE ***
    *** YOUR EMAIL HERE ***
